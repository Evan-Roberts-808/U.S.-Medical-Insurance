# U.S.-Medical-Insurance

## Overview

This project,"US Medical Insurance," serves as the final project for the Data Science Foundations section in Codecademy's Data Scientist: Analytics career path. The primary objective is to utilize Python syntax and Jupityr Notebook to sort and analyze data related to U.S. medical insurance costs.

## Project Structure
The notebook is organized into several sections, each focusing on specific aspects of our analysis.

- <b>Data Preparation:</b> This section is the importation of the data CSV and cleaning / preprocessing into an appropriate dataframe to be used.
- <b>Feature Analysis:</b> This section is a breakdown of aspects of our data itself, to give the reader a breakdown of the information.
- <b>Insurance Cost Analysis:</b> This section breaks down the difference in insurance cost across the various factors in our data.

## Findings
- <b>Age and Insurance Costs:</b> The analysis reveals a correlation between age groups and insurance costs. The average and median costs tend to increase with age.
- <b>Smoking and Costs:</b> Smokers tend to have significantly higher insurance costs compared to non-smokers.
- <b>Geographical Impact:</b> Insurance costs vary across different regions, with certain regions showing higher average costs.
- <b>Parental Status and Costs:</b> There is an exploration of the relationship between being a parent and insurance costs.
- <b>BMI and Costs:</b> BMI (Body Mass Index) is analyzed in relation to insurance costs, uncovering potential correlations.

## Usage 
you can view the code and visualizations directly in your browser. Running the project locally is not required. Simply view the file 'us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb' and navigate through the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis.

## Conclusion
The US Medical Insurance Analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing insurance costs. The project demonstrates practical application of Python syntax and data analysis techniques in a real-world context.
